# CSCourse_lightracer

To launch the project: python main.py

Each player directs a light whose trail turns into a wall along the way. If a player's light collides with his own trace, that of an opposing player, or the edges of the game, it's lost. The player who wins is the last to remain alive.

Use the arrow keys to move the lights.

!!!( Unfortunately, my project doesn't work completely. When I launch it with another player, we're both able to connect to the server, but as soon as we try to move our lights, the game window freezes. I haven't been able to find the cause of the problem. I thought it might be the file imports too, so I removed all the files from their folders, but nothing helped. I think the problem comes from network errors and more precisely from my server.py code. I'll have to find out more and try to solve the problem. )!!!
